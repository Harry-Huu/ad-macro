# ad-macro
ads for days
idk how importing works for bluestacks

Merge the four macros in the correct order
Loop part 1 five times
Loop part 2 three times
Part 3 and 4 one time

Watches pretty much every single ad in the game
Does NOT watch the following: Coupling, Merit, Heaven sect, Rift, Earth sect (greeting and promotion), Praise land, Fortune land
Encounter, Alliance Affair, Monthly Event, Fishing.

BEFORE RUNNING THE MACRO, USE SKIP TICKETS ON COUPLING, MERIT, EARTH SECT GREETING, MONTHLY EVENT, ALLIANCE AFFAIR, FISHING IF F2P, then whatever you want
